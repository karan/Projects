Classic Algorithms
-----------------

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).
