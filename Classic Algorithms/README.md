Classic Algorithms
-----------------

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Closest pair problem** - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given *n* points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).

**Inverted index** - An [Inverted Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.
