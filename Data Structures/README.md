**Inverted index** - An [Inverted Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.
